---

collate is a "framework" (for lack of a better word) and collection of associated specialized projects that interact with NuGet/MSBuild, mostly geared toward game modding but abstracting enough to be generally useful.

collate provides useful features like assembly reference rewriting, as well as in-depth support for a couple games.
